## Description

League Utility is a comprehensive tool that provides additional functionality and optimizations to the League of Legends client. By making use of the LCU's undocumented internal REST based API, this utility simulates various actions that a user would manually perform. Combined with external functionality such as performance optimization and invisible mode, this tool aims to maximize the user experience when playing League of Legends.

## Key Features

* Headless Mode
  - Queue up for League of Legends with an invisible client with barebones specifications.
* Username Creation
  - Automatically creates a username for your account using a built-in username generator library.
* Automatic Login
  - Tired of typing in your credentials all the time? Let League Utility handle sign in for you.
* Icon Changer
  - Access dozens of hidden icons and apply them to your account.
* Level Tracker
  - Keep track of your progression and when you're about to level up.
* Auto Queuer
  - Simply start the autoqueuer and watch it work its magic as it puts you into a match automatically. Now you can use the washroom and not worry about missing queue.
* Penalty Remover
  - Automatically waits out LeaverBuster and queue dodge penalties and puts you into a queue.
* Crash Monitor
  - Crashed out of a game in the heat of battle? The crash monitor will automatically reconnect you into the game as fast as possible.
* Wipe Friends List
  - Deleting a friend from your friends list is a tedious process. This feature allows you to remove your friends with the click of a button.
* Loot Opener
  - Combining key fragments, opening chests, disenchanting loot, and selling shards is a task that most players find repetitive and time consuming. League Utility's Loot Opener combines, opens, and disenchants your loot in the click of a button.
* Performance Optimizer
  - Experience League like never before. Our in-built RAM optmizer can bring RAM usage from 1 GB down to 44 MB (a 96% improvement).
